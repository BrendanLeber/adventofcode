# Advent of Code 2020

After saving Christmas [five years in a row][1], you've decided to take a vacation
at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without
you.

The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold
coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call
them **stars**. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but
somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so
you can pay the deposit on your room.

To save your vacation, you need to get all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete
the first. Each puzzle grants **one star**. Good luck!
