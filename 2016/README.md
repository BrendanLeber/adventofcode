# Advent of Code 2016

Santa's sleigh uses a very high-precision clock to guide its movements, and the
clock's oscillator is regulated by stars.  Unfortunately, the stars have been
stolen... by the Easter Bunny.  To save Christmas, Santa needs you to retrieve
all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each
day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the
first.  Each puzzle grants **one star**.  Good luck!
