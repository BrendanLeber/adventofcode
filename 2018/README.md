# Advent of Code 2018

"We've detected some temporal anomalies," one of Santa's Elves at the Temporal
Anomaly Research and Detection Instrument Station tells you.  She sounded pretty
worried when she called you down here.  "At 500-year intervals into the past,
someone has been changing Santa's history!"

"The good news is that the changes won't propagate to our time stream for
another 25 days, and we have a device" - she attaches something to your wrist -
"that will let you fix the changes with no such propagation delay.  It's
configured to send you 500 years further into the past every few days; that was
the best we could do on such short notice."

"The bad news is that we are detecting roughly *fifty* anomalies throughout time;
the device will indicate fixed anomalies with **stars**.  The other bad news is that
we only have one device and you're the best person for the job!  Good lu--" She
taps a button on the device and you suddenly feel like you're falling.  To save
Christmas, you need to get all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each
day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the
first. Each puzzle grants **one star**.  Good luck!
