# Advent of Code 2015

Santa was hoping for a white Christmas, but his weather machine's "snow"
function is powered by stars, and he's fresh out!  To save Christmas, he needs
you to collect **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by helping Santa solve puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made
available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked
when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants **one star**.  Good luck!
