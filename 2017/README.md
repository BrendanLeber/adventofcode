# Advent of Code 2017

The night before Christmas, one of Santa's Elves calls you in a panic.  "The
printer's broken!  We can't print the *Naughty or Nice List!*" By the time you
make it to sub-basement 17, there are only a few minutes until midnight.  "We
have a big problem," she says; "there must be almost *fifty* bugs in this
system, but nothing else can print The List.  Stand in this square, quick!
There's no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in **stars**,
you'll be able to--" She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.

When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than
before.  She must have sent you inside the computer!  You check the system
clock: *25 milliseconds* until midnight.  With that much time, you should be
able to collect all **fifty stars** by December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each
+day+ millisecond in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when
you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants **one star**.  Good luck!
